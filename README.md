This is a Flask application that is showing data for the annual Festival of German-Language Literature in Klagenfurt between 1977 and 2019.

During this festival several prices are awarded to the best performing authors by a jury of critics (who also individually invite the authors), among which the "Ingeborg-Bachmann-Preis" is the most important.

The website shows publicly accessible data on the authors and word frequencies for the correspondent texts. Additionally the website includes several charts that show the relation between different criteria (country, age, gender, ...) and winning a price.

Ultimately the website wants to prepare for two tasks:

Predicting future winning texts by creating a prediction model,
Building a LSTM model (based on the texts of the festival) that generates text.
